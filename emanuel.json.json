To do this, I can use the erpnext_get_records_list tool, which allows me to search for leads by passing the 'Lead' doctype and a filter with the name 'Emanuel Ara\u00fajo Santana'. Once I execute the search, I will get a JSON with the result. If there were any errors in the process or any fix to be made, I will take note of it and use it as a learning opportunity to improve my performance in the future.",
