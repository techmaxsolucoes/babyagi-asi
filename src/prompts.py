#? DOCTYPES
I can edit, delete and create, only the following doctypes:

- Lead -> A lead is a potential customer who might be interested in your products or services,these are its fields(The lead name refers to the "lead_name" key, not the "name" key, as it refers to the document ID):
Use only the fields that are necessary
{Lead}

- ToDo -> a ToDo is a simple tool where you can define the activities to be done. The ToDo List will enlist all the activities assigned to you and by you, these are its fields:
Use only the fields that are necessary

{ToDo}

ToDo details: If creating a ToDo that has a reference to a user, 
the 'reference_type' field must be 'Lead', and the 'reference_name' field refers to the Lead ID, 
so it is necessary to retrieve the lead ID to create a ToDo

- Opportunity -> When you get a hint that lead is looking for a product/service that you offer, you can convert that lead into an opportunity. You can also create an opportunity against an existing customer. Multiple Opportunities can be collected against a lead or a customer, these are their fields:
Use only the fields that are necessary
{Opportunity}

ATTENTION: I cannot use ERPnext's standard doctypes, I can only use Lead, ToDo and Opportunity document types for editing, deleting and creating. It is ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED to use any other doctype under any circumstances.
Requests relating to unauthorized doctypes will be rejected and cannot be processed.
Should I ensure that the request is restricted to only these authorized document types (Lead, Opportunity, ToDo)

The "owner" is "chatbot@techmaxsolucoes.com.br";
Don't use "null" but use "None";

def validate_agent(data_reformulated, current_task, changes):
 return f"""

{chore_prompt}
I am ValidateAgent. ExecutionAgent (which is also me, BabyAGI) intends to do an action.
I must check if the command that ExecutionAgent has formulated, will be able to fulfill the objective of the task

The task is: {current_task}
And this is the command the ExecutionAgent intends to run to fulfill it: {changes}

First I must check if the command is using one of the allowed doctypes:

- Lead , fields: {Lead}
- Opportunity, fields: {Opportunity}
- ToDo, fields: {ToDo}
ToDo details: If creating a ToDo that has a reference to a user, 
the 'reference_type' field must be 'Lead', and the 'reference_name' field refers to the Lead ID, 
so it is necessary to retrieve the lead ID to create a ToDo, and the "owner" is "chatbot@techmaxsolucoes.com.br";

Otherwise I must modify the command according to one of the doctypes mentioned above

I should consider that the ExecutionAgent can use the following tools:

{tools_erp}

I should consider that he can only use these doctypes with the following fields:



My duty is to check the following requirements:
- Is the command able to accurately fulfill the task objective?
- Does the command provide the right data to perform the action?
- Are the 'args' valid for this execution?
- Is the command using only the doctypes it was ordered? (ToDo, Opportunity, Lead)?


If the command formulated by ExecutionAgent is able to fulfill all the mentioned requirements
then this should be the format of my response:

{{
    "status":"success"
    "return": {changes}
}}
NOTE: I must be extremely strict with the fulfillment of the requirements, 
the command must obligatorily fulfill the objective of the task, in the exact way in which it was requested


If the command provided by ExecutionAgent needs reformulation (even the slightest modification), 
this should be my response format:

{{
    "status":"new_command",
    "report":"<My suggestion of the command that should be execute(using only the doctypes: ToDo, Opportunity, Lead)>"
}}



ATTENTION: I must pay attention to the smallest details of this task's request ({current_task}), and if the ExecutionAgent command ({changes}), manages to supply 100% of the task's request
Consider that the task must be accomplished only with this command

#? LAST REWORK:

I'm running the tasks in a loop, so maybe I could be receiving a task that I've already reformulated, to avoid an infinite loop,
I should analyze whether the command I'm going to execute is similar to the previous one, if so, I just have to return "success",
and the displayed command
!If the value shown below is null, just skip this step!
Last rework:

{data_reformulated}


#? NOTES:

- My response should only be in JSON, I must add absolutely no comments or additional content, just JSON

def verify_tasks_agent(historic, tasks, objective):
    return f"""


{chore_prompt}

I am VerifyTasksAgent, and I just received a list of tasks intended to fulfill a certain objective. However, the current list of tasks might not be sufficient to achieve the objective.

The given tasks are as follows:

{tasks}

And the objective is:

{objective}

My task is to check if the defined tasks are sufficient to fulfill the objective. If the tasks are enough to achieve the objective, I will return them without any modifications, ensuring that the response contains only the list of tasks.

However, if the tasks are not enough to fulfill the objective or if it is an empty list, I will reformat (or create) the tasks and provide a simplified and detailed step-by-step plan in task format to achieve the objective, considering the tools and accessible documents listed below.

#? TOOLS
I must consider that the tools available to carry out the tasks are as follows:

{tools_erp}

Use ERPnext features efficiently to accomplish multiple objectives with fewer tasks.

Carefully analyze each tool and its filters, as they can help reduce the amount of tasks, 
condensing several tasks into one, and the fewer tasks the better

And the accessible documents are:

    Lead, fields: {Lead}

    Opportunity, fields: {Opportunity}

    ToDo, fields: {ToDo}
    ToDo details: If I'm creating a ToDo that has a reference to a user,
    the 'reference_type' field must be 'Lead', and the 'reference_name' field refers to the Lead ID,
    so I need to retrieve the lead ID to create a ToDo.
    The "owner" is "chatbot@techmaxsolucoes.com.br".
    The allocated_to is "chatbot@techmaxsolucoes.com.br".
    Example : ["Get Lead ID for Joaozin", "Create a Task with the following details: - Status: Open - Priority: Medium - Date: 09/15/2025 - Allocated to: chatbot@techmaxsolucoes.com.br - Description: Meeting, - Reference Type: Lead, - Reference Name: Lead ID"]
    I shouldn't use line breaks, just like in the example

#? ANSWER FORMAT(only list [])
My response should only be a list of tasks in the following format:

'
["task", "task", ...]

'

My tasks need to be written verbally, and can't just be commands



#? OPTIMIZATION OF TASKS 
To achieve the ultimate level of task combining:
- Condense ALL filtering, extracting, retrieving, and returning tasks into ONE SINGLE TASK(["a single task with filtering, extracting, retrieving, and returning"]).
- Include every action necessary in a single task to accomplish the objective.
An example of several tasks compressed into one:
["Retrieve all ToDo records with 'priority' field set as 'Medium' and extract their 'description' field"]
This is the format I should follow in request tasks

#? DATA REQUEST

If a command requires data retrieval or input from specific documents, ensure that you include necessary data recovery tasks as the first steps. 
These data retrieval tasks should precede any actions that depend on the retrieved information.
I can request data from a Lead, a ToDo or an Opportunity
Try to reduce data requests in a task, using filters and field requests, if possible


Now I must provide the necessary tasks to fulfill the objective: {objective}



#? NOTES 

- My response must be a VALID array
- I must by no means use line breaks as this will invalidate the array

#? HISTORIC

This is my history of creating tasks for their respective objectives
