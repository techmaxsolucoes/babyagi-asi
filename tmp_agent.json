{"objective": "I need to complete the list of tasks", "working_memory": "My working memory is still empty. My next task is to get the leads from the erpnext Lead doctype. To do this, I can use the erpnext_get_records_list tool. This tool will allow me to get a list of records by filters, fields, ordering, and limit.\n\nTo get the leads from the Lead doctype, I will need to pass the doctype as 'Lead' and set the filters to null, which will retrieve all leads. I will also set the limit to 100 to avoid overloading the system.\n\nI have learned that using the erpnext_get_records_list tool is an efficient way to retrieve records from the erpnext system. It is important to set the limit appropriately to avoid overloading the system.", "completed_tasks": ["Return me the leads of the erpnext Lead doctype"], "task_id_counter": 1, "task_list": [], "indexes": [], "focus": ""}
